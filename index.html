                <p>IIPL is a Rajkot (India) based consortium of web and software development. Since 2004, 
                    IIPL is helping businesses do better with digital solutions. In the last 9 years, IIPL has 
                    built a strong clientele base across the countries based on our commitment to deliver solutions 
                    that work in unique ways. This confidence has come about with sincere perseverance, constant 
                    upgradation of applied technology, and incisive experience & project management capabilities 
                    built over the years.<br>

                    It is oft repeated but irresistible to say that the world is fast defined as digitally enabled 
                    and digitally developing. In the present world scenario, much of the development is coming from 
                    the economic growth of Asian countries—China with its manufacturing might and expertise; India 
                    with the soft skills. IIPL is at the forefront of exploiting the key growth drivers in the 
                    Indian development story—Internet Technology. Yet it needs more pointed explanation of what 
                    IIPL’s core strength is.<br>
                    
                    We believe that ideas and businesses deserve customized solutions and personal attention to grow.
                    Our motto 'For your ideas, we have infinite solutions' reflects our core understanding that no 
                    single solution fits all. First and foremost is to understand your business’s action flow and 
                    its complete circle of source and supply. This understanding helps in creating correct options 
                    and presenting them as the first step. Once we have your feedback, we consolidate from the 
                    foundation points and develop a complete solution. Of course, regular updates and interactions 
                    with the clients ensure that the solutions are focused and each detail has its appropriate place 
                    and effectiveness</p>
